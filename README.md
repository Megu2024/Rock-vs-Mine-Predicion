🚢 Rock vs Mine Prediction Using Sonar Data

In this study, sonar signal data is used to categorize underwater objects as either rocks or mines using logistic regression. In naval and combat operations, where ships use sonar equipment to identify possible underwater threats, this classification is crucial.

A Sonar CSV dataset with several sonar signal intensity values reflected from objects is used to train the model. The trained Logistic Regression model uses these signals to identify whether the observed object is a rock (R) or a mine (M), which enhances underwater safety and decision-making.
